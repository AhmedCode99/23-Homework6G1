Make sure when importing this library, the import statement should look like

"import calculus.calculus as calc"

It seems a little redundant but I think the folder structure I have nowis the proper formatting for a library. 
This makes it so you can call functions like
"calc.root_simple(...)"
 
If you know the correct formatting to make it so it's just "import calculus" instead of "import calculus.calculus" 
feel free to let me know  or change it!
